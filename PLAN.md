- **Command pattern** for undo/redo

### LSP Integration
- **Rust backend** manages LSP processes
- **Message queue** for async communication
- **Delta updates** for document synchronization

### Rendering
- **Canvas-based** text rendering for performance
- **Virtual scrolling** for large files
- **Web Workers** for syntax highlighting

### Architecture
- **Event-driven** communication between frontend/backend
- **Plugin system** for extensibility
- **Configuration-driven** language support

## Success Metrics

- [ ] React TypeScript development with error checking
- [ ] Sub-100ms response time for completions
- [ ] Handle files up to 10MB smoothly
- [ ] Stable debugging experience

### Performance
- [ ] Startup time under 2 seconds
- [ ] Memory usage under 200MB for typical projects

## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **LSP complexity**: Start with basic features, iterate
- **Performance issues**: Profile early and often
- **Cross-platform bugs**: Test on multiple platforms regularly

### Scope Risks
- **Feature creep**: Stick to C# and TypeScript focus
- **Over-engineering**: Build MVP first, refactor later
- **Timeline pressure**: Prioritize core features over polish

## Getting Started

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Set up development environment
2. Create basic Tauri project structure
3. Implement simple file operations
4. Begin text buffer implementation
5. Set up testing framework

### Key Resources
